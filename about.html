        <h2>Project 1 Analog Clock</h2>
        <h3>1. Visual Time Awareness</h3>
        <p>
            Easier to grasp elapsed time: Analog clocks show the passage of time more clearly. You can visually see how much time is left until the next hour or how long has passed.
        </p>
        <h3>2. No Need for Electricity</h3>
        <p>Many analog clocks run on mechanical movements or long-lasting batteries and don’t require electricity, making them more reliable in power outages.</p>
        <h3>3. Aesthetic Appeal</h3>
        <p>Timeless and decorative: Analog clocks often have a more classic or elegant design and can serve as decorative pieces in homes, offices, or public spaces.</p>
        <h2>Poject 2 Calculator</h2>
        <h3>1. No Power Needed</h3>
        <p>Operate without batteries or electricity, making them reliable in any environment.</p>
        <h3>2. Durability</h3>
        <p>Built to last—many mechanical calculators can work for decades if maintained properly.</p>
        <h3>3. Better Understanding of Concepts</h3>
        <p>Devices like the slide rule encourage deeper understanding of mathematical relationships (e.g., logarithms, ratios) rather than just giving quick results.</p>
        <h3>4. Tactile Feedback</h3>
        <p>Mechanical keys, sliders, or gears provide physical interaction, which some users find satisfying and easier to use.</p>
        <h3>5. Educational Value</h3>
        <p>Great for teaching fundamental math operations, especially estimation, scaling, and significant figures.</p>
